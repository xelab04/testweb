# CSE Clubhouse
Collège du St Esprit takes pride in the wide array of extra-curricular activities which take place within its grounds. As a result, clubs have become an integral part of college life.

## Purpose
For the longest time, clubs have been relegated to social media like Instagram to reach a very meagre audience. We would like to change that. Instead of having clubs divided over dozens of social accounts, they all get a place to post blogs, articles or anything they want to share with the public.
Furthermore, this website can act as a "portfolio" of the numerous events taking place at school and can be a massive factor in boosting the school's reputation on an island-wide scale.

## Scope
Social media have the power to reach anyone, anywhere in the world. However, they rarely do. This website aims at concentrating all interest to a single source which itself is maintained and brought to life by the students. The link can be shared to anyone and a special domain could be procured! With an easy to maintain website, we hope to boost the output of clubs in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities.
